## Project
A101 call_report is a project from ESPAS in which the data given by the "Telefonservice" is supposed to be made more easily accessible and understandable. The goal is to be able to read out the data accurately and display the data with graphics.

## Software architecture

Laravel is a robust PHP framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This pattern separates the application logic into three main components, each with distinct responsibilities, ensuring a clean and organized codebase. Below is an overview of the software architecture of a Laravel project using MVC.

### Model
The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. In Laravel, models are typically defined in the app/Models directory.

**Key Features**
- Eloquent ORM
- Database migrations
- Relationships
___

### View
The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It contains the presentation logic and is typically written in HTML and Blade, Laravel's templating engine. Views are stored in the resources/views directory.

**Key Features**
- Blade templates
- Components and slots
- Layouts
___

### Controller
The Controller handles the request from the user, processes it (often interacting with the Model), and returns the appropriate View. Controllers are stored in the app/Http/Controllers directory.

**Key Features**
- Route handling
- Dependencyinjection
- Middleware
___

### Application Flow
Routing: Laravel routes incoming requests to the appropriate controller action based on the routing configuration defined in the routes/web.php file.

The controller receives the request and processes it. It interacts with the model to fetch or save data and then returns a view.

The model interacts with the database to retrieve or store data as needed.

The view renders the data and returns the HTML to the user.
